# Titanic-Predictions

The train data has the column "Survived" based on which we train the model.
Then based on the training we test the model on the test data where "Survived" column is hidden to check how much accuracy our model gives.
Again in the last part the training data is split into 2 parts: test and train to check the accuracy of the model.
